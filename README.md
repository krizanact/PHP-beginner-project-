## Introduction

This is my first real project(student project) and is worked with mysql (outdated) extension.
Project code isn't  really clear but it contains pretty much actions and full functionallity(CRUD). 

## Theme

Project has been worked in HTML / CSS and functional programming in PHP + mysql. Theme of this project
is local library where users can do registration and depending on their access level they can only read or if higher level
make some changes and see much more data than users with lower access. User of the highest level  is administrator and he's got access to the
everything,he can change both books and other users (create, read, update, delete, upload, download ..).
